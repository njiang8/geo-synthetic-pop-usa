# Large-Scale Geographically Explicit Synthetic Population with Social Bonds Estimations for the United States
Python(3.12) based method that generates a reusable baseline geographically explicit synthetic population for America's 50 states and Washington D.C. along with the stylized social networks (e.g., home, work and schools)

All the resulting datasets (85 GB uncompressed) have been made publicly available through BOX (\url{[Synthetic Population Resulting Datasets](https://bit.ly/us-geo-synthetic-population)}), where interested readers can download the geographically explicit synthetic population along with their social networks by state.
